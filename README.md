**NREGA Analysis with Tableau**
Welcome to the NREGA Analysis project using Tableau. This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), a significant government initiative aimed at providing guaranteed wage employment to rural households in India.

**Project Overview**
The aim of this project is to provide valuable insights into the implementation and impact of NREGA across different states and districts in India. The analysis covers various parameters such as the number of job cards issued, workforce engagement, budget allocation, and work completion statistics.

**Problem Statement**
**NREGA is a vital initiative to alleviate rural unemployment and poverty. This project seeks to address several key questions:**

1. How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
2. Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
3. What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with employment generation?
4. What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there any roadblocks to its success?
5. Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the scheme's impact?
